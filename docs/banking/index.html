<h1 class=title>Setting Up Banking</h1>
<div class=content>
<p><strong>Disclaimer 1: Below are not legal advice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer 2: Below are not financial advice</strong></p>
<p>Business Banking is a throughly covered area of starting a business mostly because of the mature affilicated marketing ecosystem exists in the financial industry(Think about all those credicards, loans comparison sites). But in the meantime, because of the various incentive behind it, you don&rsquo;t always get the full picture.</p>
<h3 id=traditional-banking-vs-online-banking>Traditional Banking v.s Online Banking</h3>
<p>Especially recent years sees a lot of fintech company getting into business banking, and they are all without exception, starting with small business owners. The logic behind it is simple, smaller customers have little negotiation power and are more tolerant for occasional hiccups in their services. These new tech companies usually built a great online experience on top of some regulated banking services the can partner with, some of them eventually became a bank but by no means are as powerful and sophisticated as those big name banks, people sign up for them usually because of easy online application process(especially nowadays most people working from their homes) and sometimes for their lower funds requirement or interest earning products.</p>
<p>With traditional banks, you can expect compliant and reliable services, reputable brand and more physical presence but often times rigid and slow moving processes and frustrating online experiences and most important, higher costs and fund requirments. Sensing fintech competitions, they often offer some sign on bonuses which is not anything new if you have been playing the US credit card games.</p>
<p>I would say for a small busines that does not expect a lot of cashflow and has little fund in the bank, those new online banks might be more suitable just to get started. One benefit is their virtual card that you could start use immediately after approval and also some of them provide functionalities needed for your business operation via their online products, e.g, expense tracking, tax/accounting help and invoicing.</p>
<p>(I have signed up for <a href=https://mercury.com/>Mercury</a>, let&rsquo;s see what happens)</p>
<p>I chose Mercury among all other heavily marketed online business banking solutions after my research conducted via Twitter(probably the only public review site that I trust) search. Most of the startup owners are putting it as a good Brex alternative. Brex is one of the more establied names in this online business banking game and has been less friendly to small business owners hence I figure Mercury might be the next good thing in turns of functionality and suitability for small businesses.</p>
<p>The application process is pretty simple but you do need to have your IDs and document of you business ready, and by now, you should already have them if you have finished <a href=https://minimumviablestack.net/docs/getting_started/>setting up your business entity</a>.</p>
<h3 id=notes-on-crypto-banking>Notes On Crypto Banking</h3>
<p>With crypto gaining popularity, it might be possible you are planning to accepting or sending payment using crypto, especially if your business is Web3 related(which if you don&rsquo;t know, pretty hot recently).</p>
<p>Right now, I would say in the US, the most important things regarding doing business in crytpo is compliance and getting your tax right. Hence I personally would favor more established names like <a href=https://www.gemini.com/>Gemini</a> and <a href=https://www.coinbase.com/>Coinbase</a>. Both of them are operating in most US states and some international countries and offers business account and commerce solutions such as receving crypto payments and invoicing your customers.</p>
<p>I do need to mention that because crypto banking is relatively new, event the big names are just doing their best, so don&rsquo;t be frustrated if you find their application process a bit unnecessarily complex and disorienting. Maybe it just their thousands of lawyers trying to piece things together, poorly&mldr;</p>

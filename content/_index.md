**Minimal Viable Stack** is a series of content I try to put down for myself after multiple startup adventures and hoping to make things easier in future. 

Being always on the technical side and had non-trivial exposures in startup funding and recruiting as well as engineering team building, this series will be focus on the technology side of running a tech driven startup. 

The goal of publishing these to the Internet is of course to get more feedback and criticism so that I can improve my business going forward. Actually, I would really be thrilled if you could create issues in [MVS's GitHub repo page](https://github.com/lobatt/minimalviablestack) so that we can make improvements and keep the content fresh together.

But ultimately, my hope is to democratize building a viable tech stack in startups so that you can **be your own technical co-founder**.

Let's make the assumptions clear.

As someone who is also plowing through all these, all things here are by no means claim themselves to be best practices or even the lowest cost solutions. The key is "Viable", meaning finding some solution to check those boxes and move things forward as long as time and money allows. 

Eventually, yes, I would like to keep refreshing it to make it a better tech stack for building tech companies, but I also acknowledge that one can never get everything right. So, take what's useful for you(and teach me one thing or two if you can spare the time to create issues in [MVS's GitHub repo page](https://github.com/lobatt/minimalviablestack) ).

The content of this site will cover mostly the technology stack you will need to build and run a "tech company", meaning a company that make products or provide services consist of(or powered by) computer software. However, there could also be pieces about operation/financial and team building, whatever consumes my time as a technical startup founder that I want to put down a note for posterity.

Given I am currently reside in the US, some of the solutions might be more geared towards doing it in the US, so keep that in mind, too.

In my early days running my business, during all kinds of applications and negotiations, it is not uncommon to get questions like "Why your business has only got limited online presence". Nowadays it is almost impossible to run a business without a website and even more so for tech related startups. 

A Internet domain and a business email is essential hence we will spend a little bit time to discuss about it.

Actually, most of the incoporaton services nowadays offers services to help you setup Internet domains and subsquently, help you set up business email with your custom domain as well as business websites. But I would spend more time on getting this done right as the Internet domain might be the first valueable property of your business and it will only increase in value and importance going forward.

## Getting Internet Domain(s)

I would drop my conclusion on this first: use [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/).

I know Google has a bad reputation of [killing its products](https://killedbygoogle.com/) but I am still recommending Google Domains not only because:

1. It has the most clean UI of any Domain Registrar. I never really understand why the providers of the most fundamental service to get one connected into the Internet -- domain name vendor/service providers-- always have the worst website and admin console on the modern Internet. And Google Domain might be the only exception.
2. It will save you quite a lot technical work when you setup [Google Workspace and more specifically, Gmail](https://workspace.google.com/) and if you fancy, Google Cloud. I know Google Cloud might be struggling as a cloud service provider, Google Workspace is far more domainate in the workspace collaboration space than you might think. and the best of all, is Gmail. With other DNS providers, you would have to do the DNS record manipulation by yourself via those last century technology offered by your Domain name vendors, with Google Domains, it is just all integrated and can be enabled via a few clicks. Get your credit card ready though, as of now, the cheapest plan for Google Workspace is $6 per account per month.

I have to mention though, Google Domain is not the cheapest place to buy domains(but the difference is usually trivial), and if you fancy certain domain and want to buy it from a seller, Google might not be facilitating that transaction, so do you own search in https://domains.google.com/registrar/search first.

## Setup Business Email

After getting the domain names of your business, for example *awesomestartup.com*, it is time to setup a business email account of yours, so that you can print *ceo@aweseomestartup.com* in you business card or more often, fill in the blank where it is needed, for example, when setting up a business bank account.

As I mentioned earlier, I would recommend using Google Workspace for this purpose, not only you will get the best email service on earth, but also a full suite of office softwares like Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Drive for all your business needs. 

And one more thing I believe would pay a huge dividend in future is: you now get one of the best Internet identity providers at your service.
